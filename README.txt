Advanced search adds multiple advanced options for the elgg search engine.

Options include:

1 Default word search
2 Category search
3 Synonym search
4 Sort option (time n - o| time o - n | alphabetic a - z | alphabetic z - a)
5 Tags (which is boolean search, can use and | or | not)
6 User search
7 amount of results displayed

Features to be implemented:
1 Relevancy
    With relevancy the admin (and at a later update the user too) can
    set the level of importance of each search option.
2 A way to upload a list of words to stop-words and synonyms for the admin.
3 User options so the user can fine-tune the engine for themselves.
4 More availability as to changing the style of the engine
    I.E. option for admins to change the pop-up to a list below the default search.
